Note: your query should be based on the actual data. It is good to gain familiarity with table contents before starting to query. 
Query should use as few tables as possible if a JOIN is required. Sometimes a single table may contain all the attribute you need.

--------Some question clarifications:------
Question 1: Multi-color bikes with red are considered red bikes.
Question 2: Orders completed without the help of a retail store are walk-in or direct sales.
Question 7: Inventory value is defined as [EstimatedCost]*[QuantityOnHand] in Component.
Question 10: Use 2002 for both amount spent and number of bikes bought. Use OrderDate when determining year. Use SalePrice as amount spent.
Question 11: We are looking for any bike with a model type that starts with the word Mountain.
Question 12: The amount spent on a component is the sum of purchase price * quantity. Please the same component may have been purchased multiple times in a time period.
Question 17: As output you may show the number of bikes for both materials. Use OrderDate.
Question 28: Use the difference between OrderDate and ShipDate.
